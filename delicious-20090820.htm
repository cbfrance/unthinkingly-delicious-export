<DD>In an event titled &#039;Online Discourse in the Arab World: Dispelling the Myths,&#039; the US Institute of Peace&#039;s Center of Innovation for Science, Technology, and Peacebuilding, in collaboration with Harvard University&#039;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, presented findings from an unprecedented, comprehensive mapping of the Arabic-language blogosphere.  Researchers from the Berkman Center unveiled for the first time a new report on the Arabic-language blogosphere, which applied cutting-edge social network mapping analysis to more than 35,000 blogs from 18 countries.

<DD>Every good programming language lets me put my code across multiple files, in a nice, organized heirarchy. One class per file and all that: essential for readability and maintainability. But if I use CSS, I can&#039;t very well organize my stylesheets into multiple files. If I do, I have to import them client-side, which generates extra hits for the user&#039;s browser and extra load for my server. As a result, CSS files tend to be monolithic multiple-kiloline monstrosities.

<DD>Abstract: A significant percentage of online content is now published and consumed via the mechanism of crowdsourcing. While any user can contribute to these forums, a disproportionately large percentage of the content is submitted by very active and devoted users, whose continuing participation is key to the sites&#039; success. As we show, people&#039;s propensity to keep participating increases the more they contribute, suggesting motivating factors which increase over time. This paper demonstrates that submitters who stop receiving attention tend to stop contributing, while prolific contributors attract an ever increasing number of followers and their attention in a feedback loop. We demonstrate that this mechanism leads to the observed power law in the number of contributions per user and support our assertions by an analysis of hundreds of millions of contributions to top content sharing websites Digg.com and Youtube.com.

The facility has been used to build the first model of the neocortical column, which consists of 10,000 3D digitizations of real neurons that are populated with model ion channels constrained by the genetic makeup of over 200 different types of neurons. A parallel supercomputer  is used to build the model and perform the experiments so that the behavior of the tissue can be predicted through simulations.

<DD>While authoring text comes naturally for educated human beings many reasons exist why creating fully featured web content is still cumbersome experience. Those reasons can be split into two main categories. One issue is efficiently finding the right content that should be included or connected to. This usually takes a lot of time. The other issue is efficiently telling the computer the relationships between our content and external content and data. This usually requires skills and knowledge from depths of specifications and standards.

Zemanta is the service that tries to resolve those two issues by providing semi-automatic process of content enrichment to be more appealing to humans and at the same time placing it in correct relations to other content in a way computers can understand.

The Freebase Database can be thought of as a huge graph of interconnected nodes that represent knowledge (in a much more structured way than wikipedia does). That graph can be viewed at a higher level through an object-oriented lens which leads to easier interaction.

<DD>The ancient and many modern Maya groups believe that the universe has been renewed four previous times. The first attempt at human life produced animals instead; the second produced a people made of clay who would eventually become certain insects (such as ants and bees); the third attempt produced monkeys; and the fourth attempt produced us: &quot;true humans.&quot; Each prior attempt at the human creation was destroyed by a different catastrophe which ended the universe. These stories vary by Maya group: the animals were nearly destroyed by a flood, the people of clay were nearly destroyed by a flood and then a global firestorm, the monkey-people were attacked by their own belongings and their animals.[21]

With this system, everyone has tools to announce needs, desires, and availabilities, and get help with projects. Community organizers, volunteer coordinators, and event planners can do more: they get software that lets them find and coordinate teams of local people in real-time. They can see who’s available at any moment using text messaging and GPS, and they can give assignments, either mass assignments or systems of individual assignments, that help even large crowds of people work together constructively and enjoyably. Cities, towns, events, and communities become more exciting, more integrated, and more powerful with this software.

<DD>Cargo cult programming is a style of computer programming that is characterized by the ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose. Cargo cult programming is typically symptomatic of a programmer not understanding either a bug he was attempting to solve or the apparent solution (compare shotgun debugging, voodoo programming).[1] The term may also apply when an unskilled or novice computer programmer (or one not experienced with the problem at hand) copies some program code from one place and pastes it into another place, with little or no understanding of how the code works, or if it is required in its new position.

<DD>At the heart of Emicus is a data collection system that gathers information from a variety of sources – government agencies, news media, voluntary organizations, social networking sites and people in the impacted areas and presents it in a real-time interactive geospatial interface. This interface serves a wide variety of purposes from the location of available goods and services to a communication tool that can be used by first response and communication personnel. We believe that Emicus will be the only disaster information source that will rely on user-generated information and in turn provide this information to the public. User-generated content has proven to be a vital resource in catastrophic events such as the California wildfires, Virginia Tech shooting and the earthquake in China’s Sichuan province.

<DD>The Flamenco search interface framework has the primary design goal of allowing users to move through large information spaces in a flexible manner without feeling lost. A key property of the interface is the explicit exposure of category metadata, to guide the user toward possible choices, and to organize the results of keyword searches. The interface uses hierarchical faceted metadata in a manner that allows users to both refine and expand the current query, while maintaining a consistent representation of the collection&#039;s structure. This use of metadata is integrated with free-text search, allowing the user to follow links, then add search terms, then follow more links, without interrupting the interaction flow.

<DD>Abstract: Otto Neurath (1882-1945), philosopher of science and political economist, was also a European pioneer of information visualization. His system of representing quantitative information via easily interpretable icons became crucial for modern data graphics. This lecture explores some of the background and some of the implications of his method of creating a visual &quot;language&quot; with easily understood and easily remembered symbols - which can be seen as an anticipation of cultural techniques beyond text, and of a new kind of media literacy.

<DD>David: My research prototypes embody a number of UI ideas that are quite transferable to other platforms. Most of my code is open source, too. This, by the way, is rarer than it should be: research prototypes often fall apart as soon as, or even sooner than, the relevant research papers get presented at conferences, and research code rots rather than gets offered free for reuse. This is sad, because reusable data needs reusable code to proliferate even more widely, but there is no reward system for making research code reusable, or for keeping research prototypes running. So perhaps people can’t “see” the Semantic Web because research prototypes are not presented in appealing and comprehensible ways, and they break down and disappear too quickly.

This is true not only from within GNU, but also in a great deal of proprietary and free software. Using a common language is quite handy for communication between developers, maintainers and users from all countries. On the other hand, most people are less comfortable with English than with their own native language, and would rather be using their mother tongue for day to day&#039;s work, as far as possible. Many would simply love seeing their computer screen showing a lot less of English, and far more of their own language. &quot;

<DD>My first stint in a newsroom came while I was a sophomore in college, at a local TV station. I was completely taken in. Visuals blaring out from TV screens and editing bays, computer terminals spitting off wire feeds, scripts and budgets and newspapers and magazines strewn everywhere, all against the crackle of the police scanner and the constant ringing of the news desk phone. I’d been jacked into the Matrix, standing right in the midst of this never-ending cascade of information. I felt more connected to the flow of news than I ever had before.

Demme, known for the Oscar-winning Silence of the Lambs, has caught the essence of the man: slim, intense, eloquent, pipe in hand, a fighter for human rights in Haiti.

Obviously, this design is very much tied to me and what I’m using it for, but the theories and methods are extensible and feel sound.

In the same book, a chapter by researcher Jérôme Tubiana points up the difficulties of drawing clear distinctions on the basis of skin colour, religion, culture, language (a number of Darfur’s ethnic groups ‘speak Arabic as their native tongue even though they do not see themselves as Arab’), or even on the basis of the division between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers (since there are ‘non-Arab nomads… as well as many Arab farmers’).

<DD>While typical news-aggregation sites do a good job of clustering news stories according to topic, they leave the reader without information about which stories figure prominently in political discourse. BLEWS uses political blogs to categorize news stories according to their reception in the conservative and liberal blogospheres. It visualizes information about which stories are linked to from conservative and liberal blogs, and it indicates the level of emotional charge in the discussion of the news story or topic at hand in both political camps. BLEWS also offers a “see the view from the other side” functionality, enabling a reader to compare different views on the same story from different sides of the political spectrum. BLEWS achieves this goal by digesting and analyzing a real-time feed of political-blog posts provided by the Live Labs Social Media platform, adding both link analysis and text analysis of the blog posts.

    * the probability of surviving any particular year of age
    * remaining life expectancy for people at different ages
    * the proportion of the original birth cohort still alive

<DD>I’ve added my two cents in with the Barcamp Africa team of creating some way for people from around the African continent to take part. One of those ideas would be to set up a live stream of what they’re doing, but that’s not truly interactive. What would be even better is for them to setup one of the rooms where people from Kenya (or elsewhere) could signup for a 20-30 minute spot to address everyone in the US.
